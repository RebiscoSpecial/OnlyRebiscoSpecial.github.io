I hide in the shadows, and play in the game.
I have sharp claws, and eyes that see,
But when I purr, I'm as sweet as can be.

"I am always hungry, I must always be fed. The finger I touch, will soon turn red. What am I?
I am a tale in children's minds, I have no pictures, only lines. I have no pages, yet I'm read, I'm often spoken, never said. What am I?
I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?
I am always there, yet you cannot see me. I come in all shapes and sizes, but I am often overlooked. 
I am your silent partner, always behind you, and I will never leave your side. What am I?
 am full of words, but I cannot speak. I have a spine and a cover, but no bones. People open me up to learn and explore, but I never leave my place.
